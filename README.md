# braindoctor/sharelatex
This is based on the official sharelatex image. However, I required some modifications to the installation and needed a portable image for use in a cluster (which means a read-only image).

This 4.5 GB-ish image contains the following:
* baseimage from official sharelatex
* Texlive scheme-full, without docs

I mainly did this for myself, but feel free to use
